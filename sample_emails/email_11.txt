Hi,

We have a new lead for a debtor we are tracing.
Name: Robert Paulson
Possible Address: Flat 3, 15 King St, Newtown NSW 2042

Can you please send an agent to door knock?
- Ask for Robert.
- If he's not there, ask neighbours if they know him.
- Do not disclose nature of the visit (just say 'delivery').

Report required by Wednesday.

Tracey
