Hi,

We need a field call on a debtor: Mr. John Doe.
We don't have a street number, just "Main Street, Mordialloc VIC".
He drives a blue Holden Ute.

Can you send someone to drive down Main St and look for the Ute?
If found, knock and demand payment of $5,000.
If not found, ask local shops.

Budget: Open ended, just find him.
Deadline: ASAP.

Cheers,
Collection Team
